# Overview
# Pokemon_Console_Battle

This software is a simple Pokemon Console based battle. Using a console and text, it simulates a pokemon battle between one of the three gen 1 starters and a wild Rattata.

The reason I wrote this software was to enhance my skills with C++. I learned a lot of the syntax of the langauge and proper file structure. I also strengthened my
knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, specifically using inheritance.
